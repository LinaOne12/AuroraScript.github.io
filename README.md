# RampageMenu.github.io

I decided to make this open src, I just used Rampage as something to test my web dev skills on. I still need some practice but feel free to copy from me if your new.

Btw the website is not mobile friendly and im not sure if im ever gonna implement it.

You can view the website here: http://rampage-menu.com/ Also sometimes the domain will stop working for some unknown reason and you will just have to wait a certain amount of time for it to work again. (Should be quick)
:)
