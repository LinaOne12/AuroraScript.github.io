# RampageMenu.github.io

I decided to make this open src, I just used Rampage as something to test my web dev skills on. I still need some practice but feel free to copy from me if your new. And yes I am still adding on to this website. 

Btw the website is not mobile friendly and im not sure if im ever gonna implement it.

You can view the website here: http://rampage-menu.com/ Also sometimes the domain will stop working for some unknown reason and you will just have to wait a certain amount of time for it to work again. (Should be quick)
