# RampageMenu.github.io

I decided to make this open src, I just used Rampage as something to test my web dev skills on. I still need some practice but feel free to copy from me if your new. And yes I am still adding on to this website. 

Btw the website is not mobile friendly and im not sure if im ever gonna implenment it.

You can veiw the website here: http://rampage-menu.com/ if that dosnt work then use https://totallynotluna1.github.io/RampageMenu.github.io/
