# RampageMenu.github.io

I decided to make this open src, I just used Rampage as something to test my web dev skills on. I still need some practice but feel free to copy from me if your new. And yes I am still adding on to this website. 

Btw the website is not mobile friendly and im not sure if im ever gonna implement it.

You can view the website here: http://rampage-menu.com/ Also sometimes the domain will stop working for some unknown reason and ill just have to reset it use this if, that happens: https://unknownuser56.github.io/RampageMenu.github.io/
